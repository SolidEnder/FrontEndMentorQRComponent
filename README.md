# FrontEndMentorQRComponent.github.io
My first completed project through Front End Mentor- Mostly used this to improve optimization skills in CSS. This is my first of many uploads for my portfolio; provided
that I learn how to upload the live static website! I might make a few minor tweaks here and there. I took a few creative liberties with the original commit, and then
I changed it to match the original specs and text. Currently it does not seem to be very well optimized for windows, so at some point I hope to fix that at some point.
If it doesn't look right on other browsers like Safari or Opera once the static site is live, assuming you come across it, please let me know! 
I'd like to improve this as I go along.
